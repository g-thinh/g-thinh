## Hi I'm Thinh, welcome to my Github! âš¡

After working as a WFM Analyst for the past few years, I enrolled into Concordia Bootcamps to start my career as a Full Stack Web-Developer. Please check out my website to learn more about my journey [here](https://giathinhnguyen.com/).

I'm currently learning Angular and TypeScript to enhance my current front-end skills while exploring Google's Material Design to bring that subtle yet polished feel to my React components and my apps âœ¨.
