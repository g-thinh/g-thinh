## I'm Thinh, A full-stack web developer âš¡

I am a coding bootcamp graduate, currently working as a fullstack developer over at [MRP Prelytix](https://www.mrpfd.com/). I like to learn about full-stack web development using JavaScript frameworks, and I occasionally write tutorials and blog posts on either my [blog](https://www.giathinhnguyen.com/) or on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/gthinh).

In my spare time, I work with [YAHPA](https://www.yahpa.org/), a non-profit organisation, to build their website that helps promote their events and projects to the Montreal community. I previously offered tutoring services to students enrolled at [Concordia Bootcamps](https://concordiabootcamps.ca/).
